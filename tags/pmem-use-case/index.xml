These problems, even though different and individual, are sometimes somehow related. A new algorithmic challenge can usually be solved by bringing it down to a well-defined problem with an existing solution. Today, we will be talking about one of such universal solutions - similarity search, which has found its application in various areas of life, from search engines that tell us what we want to find, through recommendation engines that tell us what to watch, where to eat and what to buy, all the way to data science that provides valuable input to business decisions.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to pmemstream</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-pmemstream/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-pmemstream/</guid><description>What is pmemstream? Libpmemstream implements a pmem-optimized log data structure and provides stream-like access to data. It presents a contiguous logical address space, divided into regions, with log entries of arbitrary size. We intend for this library to be a foundation for various, more complex higher-level solutions. Read on to learn about a few example use cases we have in mind. Like most libraries in the PMDK family, this one also focuses on delivering a generic, easy-to-use set of functions.</description></item></channel></rss>
