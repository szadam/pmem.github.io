Libpmemstream implements a pmem-optimized log data structure and provides stream-like access to data.

We intend for this library to be a foundation for various, more complex higher-level solutions. Read on to learn about a few example use cases we have in mind. Like most libraries in the PMDK family, this one also focuses on delivering a generic, easy-to-use set of functions.</description></item></channel></rss>
