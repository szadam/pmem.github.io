Before we go into details it&amp;rsquo;s worth having a short look at the history. About seven years ago, the first persistent memory library known as libpmem was started. The concept of persistent memory was becoming a reality. Initially, libpmem provided simple support for memory memory management on pmem. Over time, the development of hardware, software, as well as changing customer needs made it necessary to evolve the library to include new features such as support for Windows, DevDax, RAS, eADR, and others.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to pmemstream</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-pmemstream/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-pmemstream/</guid><description>What is pmemstream? Libpmemstream implements a pmem-optimized log data structure and provides stream-like access to data. It presents a contiguous logical address space, divided into regions, with log entries of arbitrary size. We intend for this library to be a foundation for various, more complex higher-level solutions. Read on to learn about a few example use cases we have in mind. Like most libraries in the PMDK family, this one also focuses on delivering a generic, easy-to-use set of functions.</description></item></channel></rss>
