Before we go into details it&amp;rsquo;s worth having a short look at the history. About seven years ago, the first persistent memory library known as libpmem was started. The concept of persistent memory was becoming a reality. Initially, libpmem provided simple support for memory memory management on pmem. Over time, the development of hardware, software, as well as changing customer needs made it necessary to evolve the library to include new features such as support for Windows, DevDax, RAS, eADR, and others.</description></item></channel></rss>
