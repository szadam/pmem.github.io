It contains many functional updates, API changes, and refactors, along with new tests and examples. As always, this release is available on GitHub: https://github.com/pmem/pmemstream/releases/tag/0.2.0 . Big thanks to everyone, who contributed!
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of Asynchronous API. It makes use of recently released miniasync library. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension to our existing synchronous API. pmemstream_append and pmemstream_publish gained async counterparts - pmemstream_async_append and pmemstream_async_publish.</description></item></channel></rss>
