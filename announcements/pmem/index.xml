It contains many functional updates, API changes, and refactors, along with new tests and examples. As always, this release is available on GitHub: https://github.com/pmem/pmemstream/releases/tag/0.2.0 . Big thanks to everyone, who contributed!
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of Asynchronous API. It makes use of recently released miniasync library. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension to our existing synchronous API. pmemstream_append and pmemstream_publish gained async counterparts - pmemstream_async_append and pmemstream_async_publish.</description></item><item><title>Miniasync v0.1.0 Release</title><link>https://pmem.io/announcements/2022/miniasync-v0-1-0-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 16:13:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/announcements/2022/miniasync-v0-1-0-release/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just released a first experimental version of miniasyc library.
